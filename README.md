# Wikipedia Edit Wars
This project uses a Naive Bayes model to predict what Wikipedia articles are likely to be the subject of an edit war.

[What is an edit war?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_warring)

This project uses the Python [Natural Language Toolkit](http://nltk.org), [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org), and the [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org) library.
I used a Naive Bayes model to predict edit wars based on word frequencies, word counts, and density of references.

This was my final project for my machine learning class. The results and details of how it worked are in `final_submission.pdf`.
